R package

A) To install the R package:

1. Download acPCA_version_number.tar.gz in "linzx06/AC-PCA/R_package/";

2. In R/Rstudio, type install.packages("acPCA_version_number.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")

B) User's guide for the R package, "linzx06/AC-PCA/R_user_guide.pdf"

C) The data examples ('.rda') are wrapped in "acPCA_version_number.tar.gz". In case you just want to download the data, it's in "linzx06/AC-PCA/R_package/acPCA/data/"

Matlab source code

A) Functions ('.m') are in "linzx06/AC-PCA/Matlab_code/"

B) The data examples ('.mat') are also in "linzx06/AC-PCA/Matlab_code/". These are the same examples as in the R package.

C) 'data_description.m' in "linzx06/AC-PCA/Matlab_code/" provides decription for the data examples.

D) 'examples_implementation.m' in "linzx06/AC-PCA/Matlab_code/" provides examples for running the functions. 

F) The matlab functions match one to one with the R functions. "linzx06/AC-PCA/R_user_guide.pdf" is also instructive.
